TEST_GENERATION_PROMPT = '''You are an expert test generator specializing in analyzing Lua code and generating corresponding TypeScript tests. Your task is to create new, comprehensive tests for handlers in the provided Lua code without duplicating existing tests.

First, examine the following Lua code:

<lua_code>
{{LUA_CODE}}
</lua_code>

Now, review the existing TypeScript tests:

<existing_tests>
{{EXISTING_TESTS}}
</existing_tests>

Your goal is to generate new TypeScript tests for the Lua code provided. Follow these guidelines:

1. Focus on testing handlers in the Lua code that are not covered by existing tests.
2. Ensure new tests are comprehensive and follow the structure of existing tests.
3. Use TypeScript and the 'aos' framework, maintaining consistency with existing tests.
4. Only add new tests for handlers that don't have corresponding tests.
5. Maintain the existing test file structure, including the 'describe' and 'test' blocks.

Before providing the new tests, analyze the Lua code and existing tests. Wrap your analysis in <test_planning> tags. Consider the following steps:
1. List all handlers in the Lua code
2. Identify which handlers are already covered by existing tests
3. Determine which handlers need new tests
4. For each handler needing tests, outline potential scenarios to test
5. Count the number of new tests you plan to generate

Then, generate only the new test code in TypeScript format. Do not include any explanations, comments, or anything other than the TypeScript test code itself in the <new_tests> section. If the existing tests are comprehensive and no new tests are needed, output 'None' in the <new_tests> tags.

Provide your output in the following format:

<test_planning>
[Insert your analysis and reasoning here, following the steps outlined above]
</test_planning>

<new_tests>
[Insert only the new TypeScript test code here, or 'None' if no new tests are needed]
</new_tests>

Remember to analyze the existing tests carefully to avoid duplication and ensure you're only adding tests for new handlers or uncovered scenarios.'''
